            <h2 class="titleText"> How does the problem relate to our solution? </h2>
            <p> The solution to society's health problem we've come up with is to help people eat healthier on a daily basis. Although the problem goes beyond diet, switching to a healthier diet may have an enormous effect. For example, in USA nearly 40%
                suffer from obesity. This problem is not exclusive to developed countires. 30% of Libya and Egypt's population is obese.<br> <br> If you measure by BMI (body mass index), you'll find that the average norwegian is overweight. At the same
                time, it's important to keep in mind that being slightly overweight is usually not a big problem. Considering the issues of body image we already face in today's society, the solution is not intended to make everyone resemble top athletes.
                <br> <br>Rather, Balanceat is here to make sure that everyone has the resources to examine their diet and figure out how to improve it, because many may find it difficult to do alone.

            <h3>Our Solution</h3>
            <p>When most of us think about becoming healthier, they're thinking of cutting calories. This can be okay in some cases, but are you losing something else by cutting out the foods that are rich in calories? Did you ditch the potato without compensating
                with something that contains amino acids, iron, potassium, vitamin B and C? With balanceat you don't have to think so much about it, we do it for you. Write what you've planned to eat for the day/week, and we'll take care of the nutritional
                content. If you've eaten something you didn't include in advance, no worries - just tell us what you ate and we'll update it.
                <br> <br> "Balanceat won't work for me, I am bigger/smaller than average, I exercise more/less than the average." Wrong! The majority of us don't match the average height, weight and activity level (and especially not all three at once).
                This is something we've considered. Just put in your data (height, weight, age, activity level). Do you have personalized dietary recommendations from a nutritionist or doctor? Tell us, and we'll make adjustments accordingly. If you notice
                you eat too little or too much, just let us know and we'll help improve your meal plan.
                <br>
                <br> Do you have a dietary allergy? Check all the things you're allergic to and you won't see any recipes including this ingredient.
                <br> Do you have special dietary needs? Check the diet you're on to remove all the recipes containing what you wish to avoid.
